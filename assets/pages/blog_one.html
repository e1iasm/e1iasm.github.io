                Simple vs Easy: Both the words are similar and sound the same. The distinction                    insignificance may be inconspicuous. However, throughout everyday life, it's                      tremendous! Simple means something basic or not complicated. The meaning of easy                  is something that is not difficult.

              Throughout my life, I have been admiring people who do things so smoothly. Like                      they  were born for it. I felt incapable of achieving what they                 had accomplished, as their               seemingly effortless achievements painted               a bleak picture of my capabilities to do                the same. Because I have                 tried, and it is not easy. So, naturally, I concluded that               it must be               complicated. And that went on for long.
            </p>

              I would see someone leading an event captivating people's attention with a charming presence and eloquent speech, and I go, he is so gifted. Like he was just given this skill with his name. Little did I know, he had been practicing his speaking skills and stage presence way before he would be on that stage to mesmerize me.
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              I would look at many accomplished people on TV, social media, or in real life being their best selves and that would make me question myself. If I could ever be like them. If I could really get to their level. "Can I? But it is not simple. They probably had to do some calculus-level computation in their journey to get where they are," I would catch myself saying.
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              This past few months though, I have started to see how I am capable of doing more things than I have thought were possible. What I was able to observe was the fruits of the things that I have been dedicating my time to in the past few years. They took their sweet time but arrived nevertheless.
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              They gave me so much hope. "Oh, it really is possible to reach those heights," I said to myself. Although I have had this awakening, if you will, I did not yet know how to articulate it best, not until I came to this short post on telegram by a channel called The Articulation Bureau, managed by a standup comedian named Pap. Channel <a href="https://t.me/ArticulationBureau">link</a>.

                I've learned that it's not easy, but it's simple.
Most things are simple. They can get progressively complicated but they rarely ever start out that way. Some things require more commitment than others to keep up with their complications but they're all simple at first.
But most things are not easy, almost nothing tbh. Life is hard, effort is never negotiable.

                All the more reason to just start.

              This was one of the best Aha! moments in my life. The <b>progressive complication</b> is what made it look like it is so complicated, even to start. But it is not!

            Which reminds me of one of my favorite songs. Simple by K'naan. In this beautiful song, with his honey voice, he sings:

            </div>
            <p id="text13">
              What I saw from the people that I had admired was their peak. Their remarkable win. Not their humble beginning. I did not see how they first learned to listen, and then slowly began to talk. I did not realize how they struggled to read before they could write. We all did, didn't we? We all passed through these progressive complications.
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              It is just that, when we were small, we did not have a gigantic ego or societal expectation to prevent us from starting. Ah yes, the ego. Society's favorite accessory that goes so well with our insecurities.
            </p>
          <p id="text13">
             Every worthwhile thing is going to take time. That is for sure. It is going to require you to put in effort day in and day out, hell yeah. But then again, don't your dreams deserve that? Your commitment and effort? If they are your DREAMS, they do.
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              Everybody gets the jitters. Even writing this is therapeutic to me. It helps my brain in its absorption. It is a form of meditation. Stoicism creeping in :) Well, another story for another day, maybe.
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              So, I say to you, go forth and pursue your dreams. Starting is the crucial step towards clarity. Although not easy, I promise you, it is <b>simple</b>.
