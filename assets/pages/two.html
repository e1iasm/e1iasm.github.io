              This project is dear to me. As an Ethiopian, having a first-hand interaction with the conflicts
              happening in the country, I have always wanted to understand its dynamics, objectively. But, due
              to the lack of data related to it, and also the one-sided reports that are out there, I wasn't
              able to.
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              So, you can't imagine how happy I was when I got the chance to work on it in collaboration with Selam Gebretsadik
              (my LinkedIn friend and co-owner of this project). After working on this exciting project for a while, we were able to create
              a notebook containing detailed analysis (link at the end of this post).
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              We first started the preliminary analysis using Excel, and, actually, Selam was the first one who found the
              outlier shooting at 1999 (you can see the image above). After a simple Google search, we found out that it was
              the casualties due to Eritrean–Ethiopian War, a bloody incidence which costed both countries significantly.
              <b>18839</b> dead in that year alone (1999, the war lasted for more than 2 years).
            </p>
            <p id="text13">
              <strong>Tools used:</strong><br /> ● Excel for initial exploration<br /> ● Python                for further analysis and visualization<br />
            </p>
            <div id="image06" class="image"><span class="frame deferred">

            </div>
            <p id="text13">
              The above code generates the chart below.
            </p>
            <div id="image06" class="image"><span class="frame deferred">

            </div>
          </p>
          <p id="text13">
            Finally, we did the comprehensive analysis using python (Selam did it in R, but yeah). We got the
            results below.

            <strong>Key Findings</strong>
            <br /> - Conflict events in Ethiopia are not uniform and exhibit regional disparities. Regions like Oromia and Amhara consistently experience higher frequencies of conflict.
            <br /> - Urban centers, including the capital city Addis Ababa, and specific towns like Lideta and Jigjiga, are focal points for political events.
            <br /> - Examining trends over time reveals fluctuations, suggesting a dynamic socio-political landscape.</p>
          <p id="text13"> <strong>Top 3 recommendations</strong>
            <br /> 1. Implement a robust monitoring system, especially in high-conflict regions, to promptly identify and respond to emerging issues.
          <br /> 2.
            Foster community engagement and dialogue to address underlying issues contributing to conflict, emphasizing local context.
          <br /> 3.
            Implement targeted security measures in urban centers to mitigate the impact of conflict events, especially in capital regions.</p>
